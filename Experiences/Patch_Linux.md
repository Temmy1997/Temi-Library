# Tell me the about your experience with patching linux systems
In my current job, we basically have tree steps we follow in other to patch our linux systems. In other to automate this steps, I created custom bash scripts to srchieve the three steps. 
First step is the prepatch process, this steps involves performing system checks on each servers in the change request. 
It performs OS verion checks
Checks kernel level packages that needs to be updated 
Checks the number of mount on each system.

Next i execute the script that does the actual patch.
This scripts reboots the system beaucse its is best practies to reboot afater patching.
